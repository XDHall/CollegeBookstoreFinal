# CollegeBookstoreFinal
This program allows users to purchase access codes for software through the campus bookstore.
Users can also track purchases made and daily sales of each software. This is done by clicking 'Daily Total'
Due to the nature of Visual Basic, you may need to unblock files through their properties
because you are cloning/downloading the files from the Internet.
Users will need to enter credit card number (16-digit), card expiration date, identify as a student or not, and select software they wish to purchase.
Users will be checked for input validation when trying to make the software purchase and redirected as necessary.
Software prices and dicounts are included within the code and calulated when 'Final Total' button is pressed.
